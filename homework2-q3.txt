Flexbox and CSS grid are layout systems that respond and adapt to different screen sizes. However, each has its own differences. Flexbox is a 1D layout model best used for arranging items in a single direction. On the other hand, CSS grid is a 2D layout model more suitable for more complex layouts. Flexbox items can grow or shrink to fill available space, while in a CSS grid, items are explicitly placed in specific rows and columns.
