1. PHP is a server-side scripting language used to handle tasks on the server side, like accessing databases, handling form submissions, and generating dynamic content before it's sent to the user's browser. Servied-side languages handle logic and data processing on the server, such as interacting with databases, handling authentication, or generating dynamic HTML. When a user requests a page, the server processes the request, runs the appropriate server-side code, and sends the processed result back to the browser. This process differs from client-side languages like JavaScript, which run in the user's browser to handle interactivity, animations, or user input.

2. Both PHP and JavaScript can handle variables, loops, and conditional statements. Both are used for web development and can manipulate data and interact with databases. PHP is a server-side language, meaning the code is executed on the server and then sent to the client. JavaScript is a client-side language that is executed on the client. PHP is used for back-end tasks like database interaction, while JavaScript handles front-end tasks like DOM manipulation, form validation, and event handling.
 
3. PHP can be easily embedded in HTML, making it simple to integrate dynamic content. PHP has many frameworks that can speed up development, improve security, and offer powerful tools for web development.

4. When you use include, PHP will try to include the specified file, but if it fails, the script will still continue executing, and a warning will be issued. When you use require, PHP will stop execution entirely if the specified file can't be included, and a fatal error will be thrown. If a file hasnâ€™t been included and you try to use a variable from it, PHP will throw an "undefined variable" error since the variable has not been declared in the current scope.

5. echo is used to output simple strings, variables, or HTML to the browser. It does not provide detailed information about the data type or structure of the variable. var_dump is used to display detailed information about one or more variables, including their data type and values. It's useful for debugging as it provides a complete breakdown of the structure of arrays, objects, or complex data types.
