1. DOM stands for document object model. It represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects that can be manipulated with JavaScript. DOM allows for dynamic access and update of a webpage's content, structure, and styling while loaded in the browser. DOM tree is the hierarchical representation of the HMTL document, and each element is a node in the tree. It helps lay out the relationships between elements in a document. 

2. XSS stands for cross-site scripting and is a security vulnerability in web applications where attackers inject malicious code into web pages. When executed, these scripts can steal data, impersonate users, or spread malware. It works by finding a vulnerable webpage that accepts and displays user input. They inject malicious scripts, and the browser eventually executions it as part of the pageâ€™s code. You can guard against them with input validation, framework-based protections, or output encoding. 

3. An event is an action or occurrence in the browser that JS can respond to. Events can be triggered by the user (such as clicking a button, pressing a key, or hovering over an element) or by the system (such as the page finishing loading, an error occurring, or a timer expiring). Events allow developers to make web pages interactive by responding to these actions with event handlers (or listeners).

4. A DOM event listener allows you to listen for specific events and executes a callback function when the event occurs on a target element. When you use addEventListener(), it attaches a function (the event handler) to a specific event type on a target element. The browser detects this and triggers the associated event handler when the event occurs (such as a click). It is expecting the event type and the call-back function parameter. 

5. jQuery is a JS library used to simplify interacting with HTML documents, handling events, animating elements, and making asynchronous HTTP requests (AJAX). We use it because it provides an easy-to-use API that works across a wide range of browsers, making tasks like DOM manipulation and event handling simpler than vanilla JavaScript. We load jQuery by linking it using a CDN.
