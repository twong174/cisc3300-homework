A session is a temporary state that stores information about a user while they navigate a website. Sessions are stored on the server and are typically used to track user activity and maintain state. Each session is identified by a unique session ID, which is often stored in a cookie on the user's browser. Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the clientâ€™s browser that can hold various information, such as user preferences, session IDs, and tracking information. They allow the server to recognize the user on subsequent visits and can be set with expiration dates.
