What is an HTML element? Tag? Attribute?
An element is what makes up a webpage. It consists of an opening, content, and closing tag. Some elements don't have closing tags (self-closing elements). A tag tells the browser what kind of element it is and how to interpret the content inside. Tags are inside <> and come in pairs (opening and closing tags). Lastly, an attribute provides additional information about an element. They are inside the opening tag and have a name, value, and an equal sign. 

What are the parts of a CSS rule?
The parts of a CSS rule include the selector, a declaration block, the property, and the value. 

Selector { 
	Property: value;
	Property: value;
} 

Explain how CSS rules cascade.
The CSS rules cascade is influenced by importance, specificity, and source order. You can use them !important declaration to override other rules even if those rules have higher specificity or come later in the stylesheet. Specificity determines which rule should be applied when multiple rules target the same element. More specific selectors are given higher priority. For example, ID is more specific than class. Lastly, when two or more rules have the same specificity and are not marked as important, the source order is considered.

image file called pinecone.jpg in the images directory.

What is the default behavior when submitting a HTML form?
When you submit an HTML form, the form data is sent to the server specified in the action attribute of the form element using the HTTP method specified in the method attribute. After the form submission, the browser either reloads the current page or navigate to the URL specified in the action attribute. Once the data is submitted, the server processes it and returns a response, which can be a new page, a confirmation, or some other result.
